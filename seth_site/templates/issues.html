      <dt>Socialized Medicine</dt>
      <dd>Obamacare has forced high deductible plans on working people that
      still leads them to not get care in fear of medical debt. Medicare
      expansion has been blocked by many Republican governors including our
      own. We need to make sure every Mainer has access to high quality care,
      our health is not a place for profit motives.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Full employment with a $15 minimum wage</dt>
      <dd>The state should pursue a policy of full employment, anyone looking
      for work in Maine should be able to find a position that allows them live
      and eat.  Currently the state is engaged in a race to the bottom with
      TIFs and various tax breaks to lure in business. When the state
      negotiations deals with companies looking to come to Maine employment
      figures should be part of the bargain.</dd>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Support for Refugees</dt>
      <dd>Maine should be open to everybody.  The state should be coordinating
      with the federal government to take on refugees fleeing the Syrian civil
      war. Maine is facing an aging shrinking population and these refugees
      will offer a much needed boost to our state.</dd>

      <dd>Maine should be open to everybody.  The state should be coordinating
      with the federal government to take on refugees fleeing the Syrian civil
      war. Maine is facing an aging shrinking population and these refugees
